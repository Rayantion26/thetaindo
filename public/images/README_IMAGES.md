To complete the website setup with your custom images, please follow these steps:

1.  **Open the folder**: `public/images` in your project directory.
2.  **Copy your images** into this folder and rename them exactly as follows:

## Carousel (Home Page Backgrounds)
-   `carousel_1.jpg` (The Gold/Industrial abstract one)
-   `carousel_2.jpg` (The second one you want)
-   `carousel_3.jpg` (The third one)
-   `carousel_4.jpg` (The fourth one)

## Products (Best Products Section)

-   `omega_belt.jpg` (The blue belts)
-   `niobush.jpg` (The black bushings)

## About Us

## Brand Assets
